# Almabetter-capstone-project
This is the Capstone project which is a part of my Data Science course at AlmaBetter,where I performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) .
Airbnb is an online marketplace and hospitality service platform that enables people to list, discover, and book lodging accommodations around the world. It was founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk and has since grown into one of the largest and most well-known players in the sharing economy.
Here's how Airbnb typically works:

**Hosts:** Individuals or property owners who have extra space, such as a spare room, entire apartment, house, or even unique properties like treehouses or yachts, can list their accommodations on the Airbnb platform.

**Guests:** Travelers seeking accommodations have the opportunity to browse through the listings, search for properties that match their preferences, and book a place to stay for short-term periods, ranging from a single night to several weeks.

**Booking and Payment:** When guests find a suitable listing, they can book it directly through the Airbnb website or mobile app. The platform handles the payment process, including fees and transactions, providing a secure environment for both hosts and guests.

**Ratings and Reviews:** After the stay, both hosts and guests can leave reviews and ratings for each other, helping to build trust within the community and guide future users in their decision-making.

Airbnb's success lies in its ability to connect travelers with unique and authentic accommodation options that often provide a more personalized and local experience compared to traditional hotels. It has expanded its services to include various offerings such as "Experiences," where hosts can offer guided tours, workshops, and activities to guests, allowing them to experience a destination like a local.

For this project we are analyzing Airbnbâ€™s New York City(NYC) data of 2019. NYC is not only the most famous city in the world but also top global destination for visitors drawn to its museums, entertainment, restaurants and commerce. According to the Office of New York State Comptroller, NYC hosted 66.6 million visitors in 2019.

Data analysis on thousands of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. Our main objective is to find out the key metrics that influence the listing of properties on the platform. For this, we will explore and visualize the dataset from Airbnb in NYC using basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. We have found out the distribution of every Airbnb listing based on their location, including their price range, room type, listing name, and other related factors. We have analyzed this dataset from different angles and have come up with interesting insights. This can help in making strategic data-driven decisions by the marketing team, finance team and technical team of Airbnb.
